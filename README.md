### notes:

1. there are keybinds defined for `xfce4-screenshot`:
   - `Print` - takes a fullscreen screenshot
   - `Control+Print` - takes a screenshot of the selected region
   - `$mod+Print` - screenshots the current active window
   screenshots are automatically saved to your clipboard (`-c`) and to disk (`-s ~/Pictures/xfce4-screenshooter/`) in their respective subdirectories (i.e. fullscreen screeshots are in `~/Pictures/xfce4-screenshooter/Fullscreen` 
2. `xfce4-session-settings` is primarily used for managing startup programs with the xfce session
