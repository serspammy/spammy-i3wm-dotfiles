  - alacritty (or some other terminal that'll work with nerdfonts)
    - a nerd font (duh)
- ~~[i3lock-color](https://github.com/Raymo111/i3lock-color) (replaced by xflock4/xfce4-screensaver, config exists but i never got it to work on startup. i don't know why it wouldn't work) (you probably need to build this from source btw unless you're on arch or whatever)~~

### notes:

1. `$mod+t` to randomly switch wallpapers! walls should be located in `~/Pictures/wallpapers`
2. my `picom.conf` uses the old config style because windows rules make my head hurt. sorry if you don't like badly-written configuration
3. toggling resize mode will send a notification. not having an indicator when using a bar other than i3bar always bothered me
4. multiple i3 utilities (i.e. dmenu/rofi, dunst, i3bar) have been replaced with xfce4 tools, but they have old existing configurations you can use
5. you can use `xfce4-session-settings` to manage startup programs, but sometimes it doesn't work from my experience, so doing so using the i3 configuration is a working alternative
6. there are keybinds defined for `xfce4-screenshot`:
   - `Print` - takes a fullscreen screenshot
   - `Control+Print` - takes a screenshot of the selected region
   - `$mod+Print` - screenshots the current active window
   using these keybinds to take screenshots will send a notification and automatically save them to `~/Pictures` without a gui prompt, along with a filename corresponding to whether you took a fullscreen, region, or window screenshot
