my i3 window manager configuration files. am i doing this right?

required packages: i3 jq nitrogen picom polybar rofi

additional things i use: alacritty btop lxappearance qimgv

nerd fonts used: UbuntuMono, SauceCodePro

custom polybar module(s): weather (https://github.com/Strix007/polybar-getweather)

custom rofi mode(s): power (https://github.com/jluttine/rofi-power-menu/tree/master)


note: i am very dumb and MIGHT have used `/serspammy/` for paths to the home directory instead of `~/`. if you find any instances of this please let me know!!!!

note2: the nitrogen config paths to a wallpaper not provided in this repo. you'll probably use your own wallpaper anyways just change it in nitrogen
